create flow chart for prometheus
This guide explains the structure, configuration, and best practices for the Prometheus monitoring and alerting setup in this project. It covers all files in app/core/prometheus and their roles in observability, alerting, and metrics exposure.

File-by-File Usage
1. config.py

    Purpose: Centralizes Prometheus-related settings (enable/disable, port, service URL, scrape interval, default labels, etc.).

    Usage: Imported by the backend to configure Prometheus metrics endpoint and service labels.

    Best Practices:

        Keep all Prometheus config here for DRYness.

        Use environment variables for sensitive or environment-specific values.

2. metrics.py

    Purpose: Defines all Prometheus metrics (counters, histograms, gauges) used throughout the backend.

    Key Metrics:

        http_requests_total, http_request_duration_seconds: Track API traffic and latency.

        celery_tasks_total, celery_task_duration_seconds: Monitor Celery task execution and performance.

        system_cpu_usage_percent: System health.

    Best Practices:

        Use labels for cardinality control (e.g., method, endpoint).

        Follow conventions in _docs/instrumentation.md and _docs/dos_donts.md.

3. middleware.py

    Purpose: FastAPI middleware that automatically collects request metrics and exposes them at /metrics.

    Key Features:

        Tracks request count, latency, and credits usage by user/type.

        Custom counters for VAPI and Stripe API usage.

        Implements PrometheusMiddleware class for easy integration.

    Usage: Add PrometheusMiddleware to FastAPI’s middleware stack.

    Best Practices:

        Instrument all endpoints for observability.

        Use middleware for automatic, low-boilerplate metric collection.

4. prometheus.yml

    Purpose: Main Prometheus server config (scraping, alerting, rule files, jobs).

    Key Sections:

        scrape_configs: Defines metrics sources (backend, FastAPI, node exporter, etc.).

        rule_files: Loads all YAML rule files in rules/.

        alerting: Configures alertmanagers (if any).

    Best Practices:

        Use HTTPS for scraping where possible.

        Set scrape intervals and timeouts appropriate for your environment.

5. rules/ Directory

    Purpose: Contains all alerting and recording rules for Prometheus.

    Files:

        alerts.yml: General HTTP/FastAPI error and latency alerts (e.g., high error rate, high latency, elevated error rate).

        credits.yml: Credit usage aggregation and low-credit alerting per user/type.

        pulsar_alerts.yml: Pulsar-specific alerts (DLQ rate, batch latency, queue size, processing health).

        redis_alerts.yml: Redis-specific alerts (down, high memory, high latency, connection limit, replication lag).

    Best Practices:

        Use recording rules to pre-aggregate metrics for efficient alerting.

        Tune alert thresholds to match production SLOs.

        See _docs/alerting.md and _docs/recording_rules.md for advanced patterns.

Example: Adding a New Metric

    Define the metric in metrics.py:

          
    from prometheus_client import Counter
    NEW_FEATURE_COUNT = Counter('new_feature_total', 'Description', ['label1'])

        

    IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START

Use code with caution. Python
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Increment the metric in your business logic:

      
NEW_FEATURE_COUNT.labels(label1=value).inc()

    

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START

    Use code with caution. Python
    IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

    Expose the metric via FastAPI (handled by middleware).

Example: Adding a New Alert

    Add a rule to a YAML file in rules/:

          
    - alert: MyCustomAlert
      expr: my_metric_total > 100
      for: 10m
      labels:
        severity: warning
      annotations:
        summary: "Custom alert triggered"
        description: "my_metric_total exceeded 100 for 10 minutes"

        

    IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START

    Use code with caution. Yaml
    IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

    Reload Prometheus or let it pick up changes automatically.

References & Best Practices

    See _docs/alerting.md, _docs/instrumentation.md, _docs/dos_donts.md, and _docs/recording_rules.md for guidance.

    Ensure all metrics are labeled and documented.

    Test alert rules in staging before deploying to production.

    Monitor for cardinality explosions and tune as needed.

Troubleshooting

    If metrics do not appear in Prometheus, check scrape configs and /metrics endpoint.

    Use Prometheus UI to test alert expressions.

    For advanced patterns (async, Pulsar/Redis-specific), see the respective alert YAMLs and _docs best practices.

Maintenance

    Regularly review and prune unused metrics and alerts.

    Update thresholds as production usage evolves.

    Keep documentation in sync with code and rule changes.
